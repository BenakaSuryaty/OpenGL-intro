# OpenGL Learning Repository

## Introduction
This repository serves as a collection and consolidation of the various concepts, techniques, and lessons I have learned from [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/). LearnOpenGL is a comprehensive online resource for understanding and mastering the OpenGL API and computer graphics programming.

The primary objective of this repository is:
- **Practice:** To maintain a collection of code snippets, projects, and exercises that I've implemented as I progress through the LearnOpenGL tutorials.

## Content Overview
Within this repo, you can expect to find:
   
2. **Code Samples:** Implementations of various techniques and principles discussed in the LearnOpenGL tutorials.
    
3. **Projects:** Larger scale projects or demos that demonstrate the application of multiple OpenGL concepts together.

## Contribution
While this repository primarily serves my personal learning journey, contributions or suggestions from fellow OpenGL enthusiasts are always welcome! Whether it's corrections, improvements to the code, or sharing your own experiences, feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.
